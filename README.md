# Airbnb-EDA-Project

### Overview
This project involves an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Airbnb listing data. The goal is to uncover insights about the properties, hosts, and overall market trends. The analysis includes various aspects such as price distribution, property types, geographical distribution, and customer reviews. The project utilizes several Python libraries to generate visualizations and insights.

### Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and data formatting issues.
2. **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate key statistics to summarize the dataset.
3. **Visualization:** Create visualizations to illustrate trends, distributions, and relationships in the data.
4. **Insight Extraction:** Identify key insights regarding pricing, availability, and customer preferences.
5. **Geospatial Analysis:** Analyze the geographical distribution of listings and their features.

### Dataset
The dataset includes various attributes related to Airbnb listings such as:
- **Listing Details:** Price, room type, location, availability, etc.
- **Host Information:** Host ID, host name, and response rate.
- **Customer Reviews:** Review scores, number of reviews, and review sentiments.
- **Location Data:** Latitude and longitude coordinates for geographical analysis.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Data Analysis:** 
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - NumPy: For numerical computations.
- **Data Visualization:**
  - Matplotlib: For creating static plots.
  - Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
  - Plotly: For interactive visualizations.
  - Folium: For mapping and geospatial visualizations.
- **Other Libraries:**
  - Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and modeling.
  - Geopandas: For geospatial data analysis.

### Key Findings
- **Price Distribution:** Analysis of the price distribution across different regions and property types.
- **Property Types:** Breakdown of the most common types of properties listed.
- **Location Analysis:** Hotspots and popular areas for Airbnb listings.
- **Review Analysis:** Trends and patterns in customer reviews, including average ratings and common feedback themes.
- **Availability Trends:** Examination of listing availability over time and factors influencing availability.

### Usage
The insights from this analysis can be used by:
- **Airbnb Hosts:** To optimize pricing strategies and understand market trends.
- **Travelers:** To find trends in Airbnb listings and choose properties that meet their needs.
- **Researchers and Data Analysts:** As a case study for data analysis and visualization techniques.
